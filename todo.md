# Todo List for svmai CLI Tool Development

## Phase 1: Research and Planning

- [x] **001: Analyze Requirements** - Gather and clarify all user requirements for the svmai tool. (Status: Completed)
- [x] **002: Research Solana Wallet Structure** - Understand the JSON format of Solana wallet files and how private keys are stored. (Status: Completed)
    - [x] Review Solana official documentation on keypair files.
    - [x] Examine examples of Solana wallet JSON files.
    - [x] Investigate the GitHub Agave repository for relevant CLI examples.
    - [x] Analyze the cloned Solana Program Library for insights.
- [x] **003: Research Rust CLI Development** - Explore best practices, libraries, and tools for building CLI applications in Rust.
    - [x] Identify suitable TUI libraries (e.g., ratatui, cursive).
    - [x] Research Rust crates for file system operations (search, read, write).
    - [x] Investigate Rust libraries for JSON parsing (e.g., serde_json).
    - [x] Research Rust libraries for interacting with Solana blockchain (e.g., solana-sdk, solana-client).
    - [x] Research Rust libraries for keychain/secure storage integration (e.g., keyring-rs).
- [x] **004: Design Tool Architecture** - Define the overall architecture of the svmai tool, including modules and their interactions.
    - [x] Outline the core components (file search, key validation, encryption, TUI, wallet management).
    - [x] Define data structures for storing wallet information and configuration.

## Phase 2: Implementation

- [x] **005: Implement JSON File Search Module** - Develop the functionality to search for .json files in a specified folder. (Status: Completed)
    - [x] Implement multi-threaded search for efficiency.
- [x] **006: Implement Solana Key Validation** - Develop the logic to confirm if a JSON file contains a valid Solana private key. (Status: Completed)
    - [x] Parse JSON content.
    - [x] Validate the format of the private key (array of numbers).
- [x] **007: Implement Keychain Encryption** - Integrate with user keychain services to encrypt and decrypt the configuration file storing private keys. (Status: Completed)
    - [x] Implement logic to handle keychain access (requesting permissions, error handling).
    - [x] Securely store and retrieve private keys.
- [x] **008: Implement Wallet Management Features** - Develop basic operations for managing saved keys. (Status: Completed)
- [x] **009: Implement TUI Interface** - Create a Text-based User Interface for interacting with the tool. (Status: Completed)
    - [x] Design TUI layout for displaying wallet balances and managing keys.
    - [x] Implement navigation and input handling.
    - [x] Add search/filter functionality for wallets.
    - [x] Enhance wallet details view with better token balance display.
    - [x] Implement batch operations menu.
- [x] **010: Implement Balance Checking** - Develop functionality to fetch and display balances for all stored wallets (SOL and SPL tokens). (Status: Completed)
    - [x] Integrate with Solana RPC API or a suitable library (e.g., Moralis API if appropriate and available).
- [x] **011: Implement Batch Operations** - Develop features for batch sending tokens. (Status: Completed)
    - [x] Define batch send parameters (token type, recipient addresses, amounts).
- [x] **012: Implement Token Mixing** - Develop features for mixing tokens between wallets. (Status: Completed)
    - [x] Clarify and implement the desired token mixing strategy.

## Phase 3: Documentation and Testing
- [x] **013: Write Documentation** - Create comprehensive documentation for the application. (Status: Completed)
    - [x] Document installation, usage, and features.
    - [x] Create detailed keyboard shortcut reference.
    - [x] Add troubleshooting guidance.
    - [x] Enhance developer documentation.
- [x] **014: Test Functionality** - Thoroughly test all features of the svmai tool. (Status: Completed)
    - [x] Unit tests for individual modules.
    - [x] Integration tests for overall functionality.
    - [x] Fix test isolation issues with unique environments for each test.
    - [x] Improve keychain state management in tests.

## Phase 4: Packaging and Delivery
